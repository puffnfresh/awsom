This is a small implementation of a Self-Organising Map in Python.

To run the examples you will need PIL (Python Imaging Library) installed. It is
also recommended to have Psyco installed as it will speed the examples up
dramatically.

awsom was heavily influenced by Smerity's Self Organising Kohonen Map[1].
